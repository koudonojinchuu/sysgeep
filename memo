To fill some voids in my understanding of git internals, I started reading Scott Chacon's "Git Internals". By doing this,
I've discovered that Gibak does the same, too late. But I decided not to look at it, so that I can keep a chance to have original ideas, at least until the very first release.

- Config file (wrote at setup) in user's $HOME or in /etc (with -s option)

- When executed, without -s, will use user's $HOME config file.

- Will require sudo or admin permissions when trying to do "restore" on some system config files
