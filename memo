- Config file (wrote at setup) in user's $HOME
  -> "sysgeep setup myrepo" called as normal user. If called as root, must choose/ask wether use global /etc config or /root config.
  -> but a /root or /etc config file would require to be sudo included each time doing "sysgeep save" too.
  -> case of /root or /etc only useful for system files -> in this case this is system wide, so use /etc instead of /root.


- When executed, even with sudo, will use user's $HOME config file if exists, else the /etc/ config, else error.

- Will require sudo or admin permissions when trying to do "restore".
