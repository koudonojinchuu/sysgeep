TODO
----

- also include .sysgeep_index in the add() and commit() steps

- Be robust to multiple sumultaneous run by creating a .lock file in the sysgeep git repo when used
  -> because of the mess that could happen to .sysgeep_index else

- When no argument to "sysgeep save", just check updates (in the system) to already tracked files and commit them
(one commit per modified file).
